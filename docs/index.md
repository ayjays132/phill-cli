# Welcome to Phill CLI documentation

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to installing, using, and
developing Phill CLI, a tool that lets you interact with Phill models through a
command-line interface.

## Phill CLI overview

Phill CLI brings the capabilities of Phill models to your terminal in an
interactive Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) environment. Phill CLI consists of a
client-side application (`packages/cli`) that communicates with a local server
(`packages/core`), which in turn manages requests to the Phill API and its AI
models. Phill CLI also contains a variety of tools for tasks such as performing
file system operations, running shells, and web fetching, which are managed by
`packages/core`.
